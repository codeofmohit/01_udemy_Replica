This is a passion project, wanted to test my design skills and the time i take to design a complex website, hence decided to replicate the official website of udemy, (i.e udemy.com). It took around 6 hrs for me to replicate the exact design of "udemy.com" using simple html & css. In the upcoming version of this project i will be adding custom interactivity into the design.
